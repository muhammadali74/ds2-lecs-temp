# Week 12

- the Eucidean distance for similarity betweeen documents might be somethiemes misleading since in some casesit when a subset of a document is creatd, the eucilideeaem might not be abke to identify them as similar documetn sinnce they would be eucilidean would guve aw fther distsnce

- So we might use nanother mehotd called COsine similarity
- it meeasure the angles betweeen the similarity vectors which was obtained using tf idf or some other means

- higher the cosine simlarity (range 0 - 1) is more. (wich means angle is less between them.
- subsuet simiairty is weelmapped now

- One thing we missing now is the contenxt of the word. 
- this can be done by analying what words come before and after it to understanf the context.
