## Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree inorder traversal given list in ascending order
- if a node to be removed has two subtrees, then either the maximum value fo right sub tree or minimum value of left sutree is used in palce of the deleted node value.

- If data is inserted in a sorted order then the resulting bst is highy skewed. and here the traversal time in linear.
- Hence, the more sorted the insertion order of data is, the more skewed the tree is and the more time it takes.
- Unsorted isertion --> balanced tree.
- we introduce some osrt of randomness
